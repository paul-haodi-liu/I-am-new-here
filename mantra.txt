I love you, Shan Shan. 
Well more precisely, I have been deeply attracted by you.
But unfortunately, I offended you, stalked you and finally gave up contacting you.
It has been more than a year. Eh.... This is life.
When will I ever know how to get along with girls?
I like you, Claire.
But unfortunately, we are different types of persons. 
It is even hard for us to start a real conversation.  Eh.... This is life.
